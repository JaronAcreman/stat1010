    "text": "4.2 Establish a connection between a local repo and a remote GitHub repo\n\n4.2.1 Clone an existing repo on GitHub\nThis is an easier way to establish a connection between a local repo and a remote repo if the remote repo is created ahead. We will make a connection between a remote repo in your GitHub account and a local directory. If the remote repo is not under your account, then skip steps 1 and 2.\n\nSign in to your GitHub account, and create a GitHub repo (such as named homework) on GitHub (https://github.com), you can add a README.md file or just choose not to add a README.md file.\nOn your local computer, open a Git Bash terminal.\nSkip this step if you simply want the cloned repo to be in the current directory. Otherwise, In the terminal, type mkdir myfolder (create a folder named myfolder within the current directory) and then cd myfolder (change to the directory myfolder). The directory name myfolder can be any name you want.\ngit clone https://github.com/Your_Git_UserName/homework.git (change the remote repo path to match your actual remote repo).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo specify a specific folder to clone to, add the name of the folder after the repository URL, like this: git clone github-repo-URL mylocalfolder\n\n\nNow you have established a connection between your local directory homework and the remote repo homework on GitHub.\nCreate a new file in the current local directory homewor on your local computer, such as using your favorite editor to create a file named myfirstlocalfile.txt with any content in it. Or for the sake of demonstration, you can use the following Linux command to create this file containing the line #My first local file.\necho \"#My first local file\" &gt;&gt; myfirstlocalfile.txt\nIn the terminal, git add . This will add all changes to the staging area. This lets Git start to track the changes to files in your local directory.\nNow you are ready to commit the changes, which versions (takes a snapshot of) the current files in the directory.\ngit commit -m \"my first commit from local\"\nNow you are ready to sync the local repo with the remote repo.\ngit push\nThe GitHub might ask you to sign in for the first time. Choose Sign in with your brower to sign in to complete the push.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Initializing a Git Directory Locally First\nThe previous approach initializes a local Git repo by cloning a remote repo. You can also initialize a local Git repo by using git init. Follow the following steps:\n\nSign in to your GitHub account.\nCreate a GitHub empty repo (such as named homework) on GitHub (https://github.com) but make sure it is empty (do not add Readme.md file)\nStart a Git Bash Terminal window on your local computer (You could also use the Terminal Window in RStudio or VSC). Navigate to the project directory; if you haven’t yet created a project directory such as homework, do\nmkdir project_dir Example: mkdir homework\nUse cd project_directory_name to enter your local project directory;\nUse ls to list all files and directories or use ls -al to include all hidden files and directories. In your local Git Terminal, (note at this moment your local project directory is empty)\necho \"# homework0\" &gt;&gt; README.md  #create a file README.md\ngit init\ngit branch -M main #rename the branch name to main\ngit add .  # may use git add --all\ngit commit -m \"first commit\"\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/ywanglab/homework.git #(change the remote repo path to your remote repo)\ngit push -u origin main \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nthe general command format: git push [remote-name] [branch-name]\ndifference between git add . and git add --all:\ngit add .: stages changes in the current directory and its subdirectories but does not include file deletions\ngit add --all: stages changes in the entire working tree, including deletions and untracked files. It is a more aggressive option and can be useful when you want to ensure that every change, including file deletions, is included in the next commit.\ngit add --all is equivalent to git add -A\n\n\n\nif your local project directory already 1) contains files and 2) had performed init git before, then\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/ywanglab/homework.git` #(change the remote repo path to your remote repo path)\ngit branch -M main\ngit push -u origin main\nin the pop-out GitHub Sign-in window, click on Sign in with your browser.\nNote an empty folder would not be pushed to the remote repo until it has a file (even an empty file) in it. In this case, you can create an empty file such as .gitignore"

To rename the remote origin: git remote rename origin upsteam rename remote repo origin to upstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAccording to Git naming conventions, it is recommended to name your own repository origin which you have read and write access; and the one you forked for upstream (which you only have read-only access.)\n\n\nif you want to remove the file only from the remote GitHub repository and not remove it from your local filesystem, use:\n\ngit rm -rf --cached file1.txt #This will only remote files; If intending to remove local files too, remove --cached\ngit commit -m \"remove file1.txt\" \nAnd then push changes to remote repo\ngit push origin main \n\nFor some operating system, such as Mac or Linux, you might be asked to tell GitHub who you are. When you are prompted, type the following two commands in your terminal window:\n\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\" \ngit config --global user.mail \"your@email.com\"\nThis will change the Git configuration in a way that anytime you use Git, it will know this information. Note that you need to use the email account that you used to open your GitHub account. global sets the username and e-mail for every repo on your computer. If you want to set the username/e-mail just for the current repo, remove global."
